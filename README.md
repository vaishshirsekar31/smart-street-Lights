# smart-street-Lights

The goal of the smart street light project is to create a network of street lights that can autonomously adjust brightness based on environmental conditions, detect and report faults, and manage lighting schedules effectively using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. 
This project not only aims to conserve energy but also to provide a safer, more responsive lighting system for urban and rural areas.
